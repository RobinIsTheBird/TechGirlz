[TechGirlz](http://www.techgirlz.org/) is a 501(c)3 nonprofit dedicated to reducing — and, we hope, ultimately eliminating — the gender gap in technology occupations. 

This repository contains course materials and teacher course notes developed by Robin Schaufler for TechGirlz. Slides can be found on http://slides.com. So far, the only course offering is:

* JS Intro

# JS Intro

The Introduction to JavaScript was redeveloped, starting from notes and slides by Trevor Geise. The redeveloped slides can be found at http://slides.com/robingordonschaufler/techgirlzjs-2-2.

The course notes currently are not up to date, but the slides are.

## Course Materials

There are two directories within JS Intro,

1. materials
2. icecream

`materials` is the first exercise. `icecream` appears in the slides first, but will not be gone over in detail until later.

Each course materials directory consists of an `index.html`, a `style.css`, and a `script.js`.

Each `index.html`, in addition to linking in its `style.css` and scripting in its `script.js` also scripts in jQuery and lodash. `jQuery` is easier to use than straight JavaScript DOM for displaying things on the screen and interacting with user-generated events, so these materials turn this Introduction to JavaScript into an Introduction to jQuery as well.
